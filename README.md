# CS 3210 Course Project

## Introduction
This is my implementation of the CS 3210 Course Project problem, which is loosely based on the Game Of Life.

To create my solution I will be going through several development phases:

1. Blueprinting, creating the model classes to store and manage data.

2. Implementation, creating the functionality to tie the model classes together.

3. Parsing, interpreting the given text files into my created program.
